# Grand Theft Auto V: Source Code Build Guide

The *Grand Theft Auto V: Source Code Build Guide* explains how to set up and compile the game's source code, apply patches, install necessary tools, build shaders and scripts, and includes troubleshooting tips.

For PC you can choose between 2 diffrent game versions:
- v2699 - Recommended this is the version of the leaked source code.
- v3407-3521 - This patches the code to work with v3407-3521 and uses patches to make the game work like retail (this wont support scripts).

The PS4 game version is v1.46.
